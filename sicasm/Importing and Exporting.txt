Imput files can contain import or export statements.
Each of these statements consists of a single line, and must occur before the START directive.

The format for an export statement is this:

@export name

--where name is the name of any symbol defined in the file, including the labels of memory regions or instructions.

The format for an import statement is this:

@import name

--where name is the name of any symbol not defined elsewhere in the file. The imported symbol can then be used later in the file.
