A literal can be used as an instruction's operand in place of an address.
This means literals can be used only in format 3 or 4 instructions.

Example use of a character literal:
	LDT		=C'i like eggs'

Example use of a byte literal:
	MUL		=X'2D37A0'


For a programmer, using a literal is just shorthand for defining a symbol with the same name.
For example, a program containing the above instructions effectively also contains
=C'i like eggs'		BYTE	69206C696B652065676773
=X'2D37A0'			BYTE	2D37A0

The location of these symbol definitions is wherever the next LTORG directive appears in the program specification.
All programs end with an implicit LTORG directive.

If the programmer defines a label that would collide with a literal (see implied BYTE directives above),
the assembler need not take any action to resolve this and simply halts with an error.
